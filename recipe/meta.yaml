  summary: Simple python geometry processing library
  description: |
    libigl is a simple python and C++ geometry processing library.
    We have a wide functionality including construction of
    sparse discrete differential geometry operators and
    finite-elements matrices such as the cotangent Laplacian and
    diagonalized mass matrix, and
    simple facet and edge-based topology data structures.
